        This repository hosts the Swift Testing library and its documentation.
        It does _not_ track feedback for Xcode and other closed source Apple
        developer software such as XCTest; please direct that to
        [Feedback Assistant](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting) instead.

        ___

        Swift Testing is guided by a community-driven evolution process.
        Submitting this form is not a guarantee that the request will be
        considered or implemented. If the request implies an addition, removal,
        or change to the features of Swift Testing or its public interfaces,
        please consider socializing it on the
        [Swift forums](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/swift-testing)
        instead. The Swift forums are the preferred space for sharing ideas and
        discussing them with the Swift community.

      label: Motivation
      description: >
        Describe the problems that this idea seeks to address. If the problem is
        that some common pattern is currently hard to express, show how one can
        currently get a similar effect and describe its drawbacks. If it's
        completely new functionality that cannot be emulated, motivate why this
        new functionality would help create better Swift tests.
