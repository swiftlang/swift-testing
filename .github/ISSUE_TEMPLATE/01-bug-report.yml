        This repository hosts the Swift Testing library and its documentation.
        It does _not_ track feedback for Xcode and other closed source Apple
        developer software such as XCTest; please direct that to
        [Feedback Assistant](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting) instead.
  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Description
      description: >
        A concise description of what causes the problem, in human language.
        Though not required, it may help us to more accurately triage the issue
        as well as understand a non-trivial test case.

      label: Reproduction
      description: >
        Provide an example, preferably in a Markdown code block, and explain how
        to build or run it to reproduce the problem. If the problem is a poor or
        unexpected diagnostic, fix-it, or other output, please show this output
        as is. For example, paste it from the terminal. Consider reducing the
        example to the smallest amount of code possible â€” a smaller example is
        easier to reason about and more appealing to contributors.
