/// This header includes other headers (either those from the C standard library
/// or platform-specific headers) that are used by the testing library.
///
/// Include any headers here from the C standard library that are needed by the
/// testing library. Because the C standard library cannot be directly imported
/// into Swift without introducing a module dependency (and because the name of
/// that module varies on a platform-by-platform basis), we instead include C
/// standard library headers _à la carte_. Symbols from these headers are then
/// imported into Swift when a Swift file imports the `TestingInternals` module.
///
/// Also include any platform-specific headers here that are needed by the
/// testing library.
///
/// - Note: Avoid including headers that aren't actually used.
