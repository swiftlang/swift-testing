# Although this library links Foundation on all platforms, it only does so using
# `target_link_libraries()` when building for non-Apple platforms. This is
# because that command uses the `-lFoundation` linker flag, but on Apple
# platforms Foundation is a .framework and requires a different flag. However,
# we don't need to explicitly pass any linker flag since it's handled
# automatically on Apple platforms via auto-linking.
