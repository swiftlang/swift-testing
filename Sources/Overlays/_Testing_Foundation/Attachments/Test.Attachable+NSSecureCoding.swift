  /// into a buffer, then call a function and pass that buffer to it.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - attachment: The attachment that is requesting a buffer (that is, the
  ///     attachment containing this instance.)
  ///   - body: A function to call. A temporary buffer containing a data
  ///     representation of this instance is passed to it.
  ///
  /// - Returns: Whatever is returned by `body`.
  ///
  /// - Throws: Whatever is thrown by `body`, or any error that prevented the
  ///   creation of the buffer.
  ///
  /// The testing library uses this function when writing an attachment to a
  /// test report or to a file on disk. The encoding used depends on the path
  /// extension specified by the value of `attachment`'s ``Testing/Test/Attachment/preferredName``
  /// property:
  ///
  /// | Extension | Encoding Used | Encoder Used |
  /// |-|-|-|
  /// | `".xml"` | XML property list | [`NSKeyedArchiver`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nskeyedarchiver) |
  /// | None, `".plist"` | Binary property list | [`NSKeyedArchiver`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nskeyedarchiver) |
  ///
  /// OpenStep-style property lists are not supported. If a value conforms to
  /// _both_ [`Encodable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/encodable)
  /// _and_ [`NSSecureCoding`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nssecurecoding),
  /// the default implementation of this function uses the value's conformance
  /// to `Encodable`.
  ///
  /// - Note: On Apple platforms, if the attachment's preferred name includes
  ///   some other path extension, that path extension must represent a type
  ///   that conforms to [`UTType.propertyList`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uniformtypeidentifiers/uttype-swift.struct/propertylist).
