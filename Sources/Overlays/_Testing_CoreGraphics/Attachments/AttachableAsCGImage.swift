///
/// Instances of types conforming to this protocol do not themselves conform to
/// ``Testing/Attachable``. Instead, the testing library provides additional
/// initializers on ``Testing/Attachment`` that take instances of such types and
/// handle converting them to image data when needed.
///
/// The following system-provided image types conform to this protocol and can
/// be attached to a test:
///
/// - [`CGImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgimage)
///
/// You do not generally need to add your own conformances to this protocol. If
/// you have an image in another format that needs to be attached to a test,
/// first convert it to an instance of one of the types above.
