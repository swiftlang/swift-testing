/// Confirm that some event occurs during the invocation of a function.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - comment: An optional comment to apply to any issues generated by this
///     function.
///   - expectedCount: The number of times the expected event should occur when
///     `body` is invoked. The default value of this argument is `1`, indicating
///     that the event should occur exactly once. Pass `0` if the event should
///     _never_ occur when `body` is invoked.
///   - isolation: The actor to which `body` is isolated, if any.
///   - sourceLocation: The source location to which any recorded issues should
///     be attributed.
///   - body: The function to invoke.
///
/// - Returns: Whatever is returned by `body`.
///
/// - Throws: Whatever is thrown by `body`.
///
/// Use confirmations to check that an event occurs while a test is running in
/// complex scenarios where `#expect()` and `#require()` are insufficient. For
/// example, a confirmation may be useful when an expected event occurs:
///
/// - In a context that cannot be awaited by the calling function such as an
///   event handler or delegate callback;
/// - More than once, or never; or
/// - As a callback that is invoked as part of a larger operation.
///
/// To use a confirmation, pass a closure containing the work to be performed.
/// The testing library will then pass an instance of ``Confirmation`` to the
/// closure. Every time the event in question occurs, the closure should call
/// the confirmation:
///
/// ```swift
/// let n = 10
/// await confirmation("Baked buns", expectedCount: n) { bunBaked in
///   foodTruck.eventHandler = { event in
///     if event == .baked(.cinnamonBun) {
///       bunBaked()
///     }
///   }
///   await foodTruck.bake(.cinnamonBun, count: n)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When the closure returns, the testing library checks if the confirmation's
/// preconditions have been met, and records an issue if they have not.
