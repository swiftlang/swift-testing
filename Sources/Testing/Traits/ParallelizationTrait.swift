/// A type that defines whether the testing library runs this test serially
/// or in parallel.
///
/// When you add this trait to a parameterized test function, that test runs its
/// cases serially instead of in parallel. This trait has no effect when you
/// apply it to a non-parameterized test function.
///
/// When you add this trait to a test suite, that suite runs its
/// contained test functions (including their cases, when parameterized) and
/// sub-suites serially instead of in parallel. If the sub-suites have children,
/// they also run serially.
///
/// This trait does not affect the execution of a test relative to its peers or
/// to unrelated tests. This trait has no effect if you disable test
/// parallelization globally (for example, by passing `--no-parallel` to the
/// `swift test` command.)
///
/// To add this trait to a test, use ``Trait/serialized``.
