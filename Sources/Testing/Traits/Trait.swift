/// A protocol describing traits that can be added to a test function or to a
/// test suite.
///
/// The testing library defines a number of traits that can be added to test
/// functions and to test suites. Developers can define their own traits by
/// creating types that conform to ``TestTrait`` and/or ``SuiteTrait``.
///
/// When creating a custom trait type, the type should conform to ``TestTrait``
/// if it can be added to test functions, ``SuiteTrait`` if it can be added to
/// test suites, and both ``TestTrait`` and ``SuiteTrait`` if it can be added to
/// both test functions _and_ test suites.
public protocol Trait: Sendable {
  /// Prepare to run the test to which this trait was added.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - test: The test to which this trait was added.
  ///
  /// - Throws: Any error that would prevent the test from running. If an error
  ///   is thrown from this method, the test will be skipped and the error will
  ///   be recorded as an ``Issue``.
  ///
  /// This method is called after all tests and their traits have been
  /// discovered by the testing library, but before any test has begun running.
  /// It may be used to prepare necessary internal state, or to influence
  /// whether the test should run.
  ///
  /// The default implementation of this method does nothing.
  func prepare(for test: Test) async throws

  ///
  /// By default, the value of this property is an empty array.
  var comments: [Comment] { get }

  /// The type of the test scope provider for this trait.
  ///
  /// The default type is `Never`, which cannot be instantiated. The
  /// ``scopeProvider(for:testCase:)-cjmg`` method for any trait with this
  /// default type must return `nil`, meaning that trait will not provide a
  /// custom scope for the tests it's applied to.
  associatedtype TestScopeProvider: TestScoping = Never

  /// Get this trait's scope provider for the specified test and/or test case,
  /// if any.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - test: The test for which a scope provider is being requested.
  ///   - testCase: The test case for which a scope provider is being requested,
  ///     if any. When `test` represents a suite, the value of this argument is
  ///     `nil`.
  ///
  /// - Returns: A value conforming to ``Trait/TestScopeProvider`` which may be
  ///   used to provide custom scoping for `test` and/or `testCase`, or `nil` if
  ///   they should not have any custom scope.
  ///
  /// If this trait's type conforms to ``TestScoping``, the default value
  /// returned by this method depends on `test` and/or `testCase`:
  ///
  /// - If `test` represents a suite, this trait must conform to ``SuiteTrait``.
  ///   If the value of this suite trait's ``SuiteTrait/isRecursive`` property
  ///   is `true`, then this method returns `nil`; otherwise, it returns `self`.
  ///   This means that by default, a suite trait will _either_ provide its
  ///   custom scope once for the entire suite, or once per-test function it
  ///   contains.
  /// - Otherwise `test` represents a test function. If `testCase` is `nil`,
  ///   this method returns `nil`; otherwise, it returns `self`. This means that
  ///   by default, a trait which is applied to or inherited by a test function
  ///   will provide its custom scope once for each of that function's cases.
  ///
  /// A trait may explicitly implement this method to further customize the
  /// default behaviors above. For example, if a trait should provide custom
  /// test scope both once per-suite and once per-test function in that suite,
  /// it may implement the method and return a non-`nil` scope provider under
  /// those conditions.
  ///
  /// A trait may also implement this method and return `nil` if it determines
  /// that it does not need to provide a custom scope for a particular test at
  /// runtime, even if the test has the trait applied. This can improve
  /// performance and make diagnostics clearer by avoiding an unnecessary call
  /// to ``TestScoping/provideScope(for:testCase:performing:)``.
  ///
  /// If this trait's type does not conform to ``TestScoping`` and its
  /// associated ``Trait/TestScopeProvider`` type is the default `Never`, then
  /// this method returns `nil` by default. This means that instances of this
  /// trait will not provide a custom scope for tests to which they're applied.

/// A protocol that allows providing a custom execution scope for a test
/// function (and each of its cases) or a test suite by performing custom code
/// before or after it runs.
///
/// Types conforming to this protocol may be used in conjunction with a
/// ``Trait``-conforming type by implementing the
/// ``Trait/scopeProvider(for:testCase:)-cjmg`` method, allowing custom traits
/// to provide custom scope for tests. Consolidating common set-up and tear-down
/// logic for tests which have similar needs allows each test function to be
/// more succinct with less repetitive boilerplate so it can focus on what makes
/// it unique.
public protocol TestScoping: Sendable {
  /// Provide custom execution scope for a function call which is related to the
  /// specified test and/or test case.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - test: The test under which `function` is being performed.
  ///   - testCase: The test case, if any, under which `function` is being
  ///     performed. When invoked on a suite, the value of this argument is
  ///     `nil`.
  ///   - function: The function to perform. If `test` represents a test suite,
  ///     this function encapsulates running all the tests in that suite. If
  ///     `test` represents a test function, this function is the body of that
  ///     test function (including all cases if it is parameterized.)
  ///
  /// - Throws: Whatever is thrown by `function`, or an error preventing this
  ///   type from providing a custom scope correctly. An error thrown from this
  ///   method is recorded as an issue associated with `test`. If an error is
  ///   thrown before `function` is called, the corresponding test will not run.
  ///
  /// When the testing library is preparing to run a test, it starts by finding
  /// all traits applied to that test, including those inherited from containing
  /// suites. It begins with inherited suite traits, sorting them
  /// outermost-to-innermost, and if the test is a function, it then adds all
  /// traits applied directly to that functions in the order they were applied
  /// (left-to-right). It then asks each trait for its scope provider (if any)
  /// by calling ``Trait/scopeProvider(for:testCase:)-cjmg``. Finally, it calls
  /// this method on all non-`nil` scope providers, giving each an opportunity
  /// to perform arbitrary work before or after invoking `function`.
  ///
  /// This method should either invoke `function` once before returning or throw
  /// an error if it is unable to provide a custom scope.
  ///
  /// Issues recorded by this method are associated with `test`.
