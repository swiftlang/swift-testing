/// A type that defines a condition which must be satisfied for the testing
/// library to save attachments recorded by a test.
///
/// To add this trait to a test, use one of the following functions:
///
/// - ``Trait/savingAttachments(if:)``
///
/// By default, the testing library saves your attachments as soon as you call
/// ``Attachment/record(_:named:sourceLocation:)``. You can access saved
/// attachments after your tests finish running:
///
/// - When using Xcode, you can access attachments from the test report.
/// - When using Visual Studio Code, the testing library saves attachments to
///   `.build/attachments` by default. Visual Studio Code reports the paths to
///   individual attachments in its Tests Results panel.
/// - When using Swift Package Manager's `swift test` command, you can pass the
///   `--attachments-path` option. The testing library saves attachments to the
///   specified directory.
///
/// If you add an instance of this trait type to a test, any attachments that
/// test records are stored in memory until the test finishes running. The
/// testing library then evaluates the instance's condition and, if the
/// condition is met, saves the attachments.
