Migrate an existing test method or test class written using XCTest.

## Overview

The testing library provides much of the same functionality of XCTest, but uses
its own syntax to declare test functions and types. Here, you'll learn how to
convert XCTest-based content to use the testing library instead.

### Import the testing library

XCTest and the testing library are available from different modules. Instead of 
importing the XCTest module, import the Testing module:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    import XCTest
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    import Testing
    ```
  }
}

A single source file can contain tests written with XCTest as well as other 
tests written with the testing library. Import both XCTest and Testing if a 
source file contains mixed test content.

### Convert test classes

XCTest groups related sets of test methods in test classes: classes that inherit
from the [`XCTestCase`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestcase)
class provided by the [XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest) framework. The testing library doesn't require
that test functions be instance members of types. Instead, they can be _free_ or
_global_ functions, or can be `static` or `class` members of a type.

If you want to group your test functions together, you can do so by placing them
in a Swift type. The testing library refers to such a type as a _suite_. These
types do _not_ need to be classes, and they don't inherit from `XCTestCase`.

To convert a subclass of `XCTestCase` to a suite, remove the `XCTestCase`
conformance. It's also generally recommended that a Swift structure or actor be
used instead of a class because it allows the Swift compiler to better-enforce
concurrency safety:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    struct FoodTruckTests {
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

For more information about suites and how to declare and customize them, see
<doc:OrganizingTests>.

### Convert setup and teardown functions

In XCTest, code can be scheduled to run before and after a test using the
[`setUp()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctest/3856481-setup)
and [`tearDown()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctest/3856482-teardown)
family of functions. When writing tests using the testing library, implement
`init()` and/or `deinit` instead:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
      var batteryLevel: NSNumber!
      override func setUp() async throws {
        batteryLevel = 100
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    struct FoodTruckTests {
      var batteryLevel: NSNumber
      init() async throws {
        batteryLevel = 100
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

The use of `async` and `throws` is optional. If teardown is needed, declare your
test suite as a class or as an actor rather than as a structure and implement
`deinit`:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
      var batteryLevel: NSNumber!
      override func setUp() async throws {
        batteryLevel = 100
      }
      override func tearDown() {
        batteryLevel = 0 // drain the battery
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    final class FoodTruckTests {
      var batteryLevel: NSNumber
      init() async throws {
        batteryLevel = 100
      }
      deinit {
        batteryLevel = 0 // drain the battery
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

<!--
- Bug: `deinit` cannot be asynchronous or throwing, unlike `tearDown()`.

### Convert test methods

The testing library represents individual tests as functions, similar to how
they are represented in XCTest. However, the syntax for declaring a test
function is different. In XCTest, a test method must be a member of a test class
and its name must start with `test`. The testing library doesn't require a test
function to have any particular name. Instead, it identifies a test function by
the presence of the `@Test` attribute:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
      func testEngineWorks() { ... }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    struct FoodTruckTests {
      @Test func engineWorks() { ... }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

As with XCTest, the testing library allows test functions to be marked `async`,
`throws`, or `async`-`throws`, and to be isolated to a global actor (for example, by using the
`@MainActor` attribute.)

- Note: XCTest runs synchronous test methods on the main actor by default, while
  the testing library runs all test functions on an arbitrary task. If a test
  function must run on the main thread, isolate it to the main actor with
  `@MainActor`, or run the thread-sensitive code inside a call to
  [`MainActor.run(resultType:body:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mainactor/run(resulttype:body:)).

For more information about test functions and how to declare and customize them,
see <doc:DefiningTests>.

### Check for expected values and outcomes 

XCTest uses a family of approximately 40 functions to assert test requirements.
These functions are collectively referred to as
[`XCTAssert()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/1500669-xctassert).
The testing library has two replacements, ``expect(_:_:sourceLocation:)`` and
``require(_:_:sourceLocation:)-5l63q``. They both behave similarly to
`XCTAssert()` except that ``require(_:_:sourceLocation:)-5l63q`` throws an
error if its condition isn't met:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    func testEngineWorks() throws {
      let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
      XCTAssertNotNil(engine.parts.first)
      XCTAssertGreaterThan(engine.batteryLevel, 0)
      try engine.start()
      XCTAssertTrue(engine.isRunning)
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    @Test func engineWorks() throws {
      let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
      try #require(engine.parts.first != nil)
      #expect(engine.batteryLevel > 0)
      try engine.start()
      #expect(engine.isRunning)
    }
    ```
  }
}

### Check for optional values

XCTest also has a function, [`XCTUnwrap()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3380195-xctunwrap),
that tests if an optional value is `nil` and throws an error if it is. When
using the testing library, you can use ``require(_:_:sourceLocation:)-1k9w3``
with optional expressions to unwrap them:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    func testEngineWorks() throws {
      let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
      let part = try XCTUnwrap(engine.parts.first)
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    @Test func engineWorks() throws {
      let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
      let part = try #require(engine.parts.first)
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

### Record issues

XCTest has a function, [`XCTFail()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/1500970-xctfail),
that causes a test to fail immediately and unconditionally. This function is
useful when the syntax of the language prevents the use of an `XCTAssert()`
function. To record an unconditional issue using the testing library, use the
``Issue/record(_:severity:sourceLocation:)`` function:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    func testEngineWorks() {
      let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
      guard case .electric = engine else {
        XCTFail("Engine is not electric")
        return
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    @Test func engineWorks() {
      let engine = FoodTruck.shared.engine
      guard case .electric = engine else {
        Issue.record("Engine is not electric")
        return
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

The following table includes a list of the various `XCTAssert()` functions and
their equivalents in the testing library:

| XCTest | Swift Testing |
|-|-|
| `XCTAssert(x)`, `XCTAssertTrue(x)` | `#expect(x)` |
| `XCTAssertFalse(x)` | `#expect(!x)` |
| `XCTAssertNil(x)` | `#expect(x == nil)` |
| `XCTAssertNotNil(x)` | `#expect(x != nil)` |
| `XCTAssertEqual(x, y)` | `#expect(x == y)` |
| `XCTAssertNotEqual(x, y)` | `#expect(x != y)` |
| `XCTAssertIdentical(x, y)` | `#expect(x === y)` |
| `XCTAssertNotIdentical(x, y)` | `#expect(x !== y)` |
| `XCTAssertGreaterThan(x, y)` | `#expect(x > y)` |
| `XCTAssertGreaterThanOrEqual(x, y)` | `#expect(x >= y)` |
| `XCTAssertLessThanOrEqual(x, y)` | `#expect(x <= y)` |
| `XCTAssertLessThan(x, y)` | `#expect(x < y)` |
| `XCTAssertThrowsError(try f())` | `#expect(throws: (any Error).self) { try f() }` |
| `XCTAssertThrowsError(try f()) { error in … }` | `let error = #expect(throws: (any Error).self) { try f() }` |
| `XCTAssertNoThrow(try f())` | `#expect(throws: Never.self) { try f() }` |
| `try XCTUnwrap(x)` | `try #require(x)` |
| `XCTFail("…")` | `Issue.record("…")` |

The testing library doesn’t provide an equivalent of
[`XCTAssertEqual(_:_:accuracy:_:file:line:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3551607-xctassertequal).
To compare two numeric values within a specified accuracy, 
use `isApproximatelyEqual()` from [swift-numerics](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics).

### Continue or halt after test failures

An instance of an `XCTestCase` subclass can set its
[`continueAfterFailure`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestcase/1496260-continueafterfailure)
property to `false` to cause a test to stop running after a failure occurs.
XCTest stops an affected test by throwing an Objective-C exception at the
time the failure occurs.

- Note: `continueAfterFailure` isn't fully supported when using the
  [swift-corelibs-xctest](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-corelibs-xctest)
  library on non-Apple platforms.

The behavior of an exception thrown through a Swift stack frame is undefined. If
an exception is thrown through an `async` Swift function, it typically causes
the process to terminate abnormally, preventing other tests from running.

The testing library doesn't use exceptions to stop test functions. Instead, use
the ``require(_:_:sourceLocation:)-5l63q`` macro, which throws a Swift error on
failure:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    func testTruck() async {
      continueAfterFailure = false
      XCTAssertTrue(FoodTruck.shared.isLicensed)
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    @Test func truck() throws {
      try #require(FoodTruck.shared.isLicensed)
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

When using either `continueAfterFailure` or
``require(_:_:sourceLocation:)-5l63q``, other tests will continue to run after
the failed test method or test function.

### Validate asynchronous behaviors

XCTest has a class, [`XCTestExpectation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestexpectation),
that represents some asynchronous condition. You create an instance of
this class (or a subclass like [`XCTKeyPathExpectation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctkeypathexpectation))
using an initializer or a convenience method on `XCTestCase`. When the condition
represented by an expectation occurs, the developer _fulfills_ the expectation.
Concurrently, the developer _waits for_ the expectation to be fulfilled using an
instance of [`XCTWaiter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctwaiter)
or using a convenience method on `XCTestCase`.

Wherever possible, prefer to use Swift concurrency to validate asynchronous
conditions. For example, if it's necessary to determine the result of an
asynchronous Swift function, it can be awaited with `await`. For a function that
takes a completion handler but which doesn't use `await`, a Swift
[continuation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withcheckedcontinuation(isolation:function:_:))
can be used to convert the call into an `async`-compatible one.

Some tests, especially those that test asynchronously-delivered events, cannot
be readily converted to use Swift concurrency. The testing library offers
functionality called _confirmations_ which can be used to implement these tests.
Instances of ``Confirmation`` are created and used within the scope of the
functions ``confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)-5mqz2``
and ``confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)-l3il``.

Confirmations function similarly to the expectations API of XCTest, however,
they don't block or suspend the caller while waiting for a condition to be
fulfilled. Instead, the requirement is expected to be _confirmed_ (the
equivalent of _fulfilling_ an expectation) before `confirmation()` returns, and
records an issue otherwise:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    func testTruckEvents() async {
      let soldFood = expectation(description: "…")
      FoodTruck.shared.eventHandler = { event in
        if case .soldFood = event {
          soldFood.fulfill()
        }
      }
      await Customer().buy(.soup)
      await fulfillment(of: [soldFood])
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    @Test func truckEvents() async {
      await confirmation("…") { soldFood in
        FoodTruck.shared.eventHandler = { event in
          if case .soldFood = event {
            soldFood()
          }
        }
        await Customer().buy(.soup)
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

By default, `XCTestExpectation` expects to be fulfilled exactly once, and will
record an issue in the current test if it is not fulfilled or if it is fulfilled
more than once. `Confirmation` behaves the same way and expects to be confirmed
exactly once by default. You can configure the number of times an expectation
should be fulfilled by setting its [`expectedFulfillmentCount`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestexpectation/2806572-expectedfulfillmentcount)
property, and you can pass a value for the `expectedCount` argument of
``confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)-5mqz2`` for the same
purpose.

`XCTestExpectation` has a property, [`assertForOverFulfill`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestexpectation/2806575-assertforoverfulfill),
which when set to `false` allows an expectation to be fulfilled more times than
expected without causing a test failure. When using a confirmation, you can pass
a range to ``confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)-l3il`` as
its expected count to indicate that it must be confirmed _at least_ some number
of times:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    func testRegularCustomerOrders() async {
      let soldFood = expectation(description: "…")
      soldFood.expectedFulfillmentCount = 10
      soldFood.assertForOverFulfill = false
      FoodTruck.shared.eventHandler = { event in
        if case .soldFood = event {
          soldFood.fulfill()
        }
      }
      for customer in regularCustomers() {
        await customer.buy(customer.regularOrder)
      }
      await fulfillment(of: [soldFood])
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    @Test func regularCustomerOrders() async {
      await confirmation(
        "…",
        expectedCount: 10...
      ) { soldFood in
        FoodTruck.shared.eventHandler = { event in
          if case .soldFood = event {
            soldFood()
          }
        }
        for customer in regularCustomers() {
          await customer.buy(customer.regularOrder)
        }
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

Any range expression with a lower bound (that is, whose type conforms to
both [`RangeExpression<Int>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rangeexpression)
and [`Sequence<Int>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence))
can be used with ``confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)-l3il``.
You must specify a lower bound for the number of confirmations because, without
one, the testing library cannot tell if an issue should be recorded when there
have been zero confirmations. 

### Control whether a test runs

When using XCTest, the [`XCTSkip`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctskip)
error type can be thrown to bypass the remainder of a test function. As well,
the [`XCTSkipIf()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3521325-xctskipif)
and [`XCTSkipUnless()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3521326-xctskipunless)
functions can be used to conditionalize the same action. The testing library
allows developers to skip a test function or an entire test suite before it
starts running using the ``ConditionTrait`` trait type. Annotate a test suite or
test function with an instance of this trait type to control whether it runs:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase {
      func testArepasAreTasty() throws {
        try XCTSkipIf(CashRegister.isEmpty)
        try XCTSkipUnless(FoodTruck.sells(.arepas))
        ...
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    @Suite(.disabled(if: CashRegister.isEmpty))
    struct FoodTruckTests {
      @Test(.enabled(if: FoodTruck.sells(.arepas)))
      func arepasAreTasty() {
        ...
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

<!-- TODO: document Test.cancel() and Test.Case.cancel() here, and update
     relevant links to use proper DocC symbol references.

If a test has already started running and you determine it cannot complete and
should end early without failing, use `Test/cancel(_:sourceLocation:)` instead
of [`XCTSkip`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctskip) to
cancel the task associated with the current test:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    func testCashRegister() throws {
      let cashRegister = CashRegister()
      let drawer = cashRegister.open()
      if drawer.isEmpty {
        throw XCTSkip("Cash register is empty")
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    @Test func cashRegister() throws {
      let cashRegister = CashRegister()
      let drawer = cashRegister.open()
      if drawer.isEmpty {
        try Test.cancel("Cash register is empty")
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

If the test is parameterized and you only want to cancel the current test case
rather than the entire test, use `Test/Case/cancel(_:sourceLocation:)`.
-->

### Annotate known issues

A test may have a known issue that sometimes or always prevents it from passing.
When written using XCTest, such tests can call
[`XCTExpectFailure(_:options:failingBlock:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3727246-xctexpectfailure)
to tell XCTest and its infrastructure that the issue shouldn't cause the test
to fail. The testing library has an equivalent function with synchronous and
asynchronous variants:

- ``withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:_:)``
- ``withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)``

This function can be used to annotate a section of a test as having a known
issue:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    func testGrillWorks() async {
      XCTExpectFailure("Grill is out of fuel") {
        try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    @Test func grillWorks() async {
      withKnownIssue("Grill is out of fuel") {
        try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

- Note: The XCTest function [`XCTExpectFailure(_:options:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/3727245-xctexpectfailure),
  which doesn't take a closure and which affects the remainder of the test,
  doesn't have a direct equivalent in the testing library. To mark an entire
  test as having a known issue, wrap its body in a call to `withKnownIssue()`. 

If a test may fail intermittently, the call to
`XCTExpectFailure(_:options:failingBlock:)` can be marked _non-strict_. When
using the testing library, specify that the known issue is _intermittent_
instead:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    func testGrillWorks() async {
      XCTExpectFailure(
        "Grill may need fuel",
        options: .nonStrict()
      ) {
        try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    @Test func grillWorks() async {
      withKnownIssue(
        "Grill may need fuel", 
        isIntermittent: true
      ) {
        try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

Additional options can be specified when calling `XCTExpectFailure()`:

- [`isEnabled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctexpectedfailure/options/3726085-isenabled)
  can be set to `false` to skip known-issue matching (for instance, if a
  particular issue only occurs under certain conditions)
- [`issueMatcher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctexpectedfailure/options/3726086-issuematcher)
  can be set to a closure to allow marking only certain issues as known and to
  allow other issues to be recorded as test failures

The testing library includes overloads of `withKnownIssue()` that take
additional arguments with similar behavior:

- ``withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:_:when:matching:)``
- ``withKnownIssue(_:isIntermittent:isolation:sourceLocation:_:when:matching:)``

To conditionally enable known-issue matching or to match only certain kinds
of issues:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    func testGrillWorks() async {
      let options = XCTExpectedFailure.Options()
      options.isEnabled = FoodTruck.shared.hasGrill
      options.issueMatcher = { issue in
        issue.type == thrownError
      }
      XCTExpectFailure(
        "Grill is out of fuel",
        options: options
      ) {
        try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    @Test func grillWorks() async {
      withKnownIssue("Grill is out of fuel") {
        try FoodTruck.shared.grill.start()
      } when: {
        FoodTruck.shared.hasGrill
      } matching: { issue in
        issue.error != nil 
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
  }
}

### Run tests sequentially

By default, the testing library runs all tests in a suite in parallel. The
default behavior of XCTest is to run each test in a suite sequentially. If your
tests use shared state such as global variables, you may see unexpected
behavior including unreliable test outcomes when you run tests in parallel.

Annotate your test suite with ``Trait/serialized`` to run tests within that
suite serially:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift

### Attach values

In XCTest, you can create an instance of [`XCTAttachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctattachment)
representing arbitrary data, files, property lists, encodable objects, images,
and other types of information that would be useful to have available if a test
fails. Swift Testing has an ``Attachment`` type that serves much the same
purpose.

To attach a value from a test to the output of a test run, that value must
conform to the ``Attachable`` protocol. The testing library provides default
conformances for various standard library and Foundation types.

If you want to attach a value of another type, and that type already conforms to
[`Encodable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/encodable) or to
[`NSSecureCoding`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nssecurecoding),
the testing library automatically provides a default implementation when you
import Foundation:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // Before
    import Foundation

    class Tortilla: NSSecureCoding { /* ... */ }

    func testTortillaIntegrity() async {
      let tortilla = Tortilla(diameter: .large)
      ...
      let attachment = XCTAttachment(
        archivableObject: tortilla
      )
      self.add(attachment)
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // After
    import Foundation

    struct Tortilla: Codable, Attachable { /* ... */ }

    @Test func tortillaIntegrity() async {
      let tortilla = Tortilla(diameter: .large)
      ...
      Attachment.record(tortilla)
    }
    ```
  }
}

If you have a type that does not (or cannot) conform to `Encodable` or
`NSSecureCoding`, or if you want fine-grained control over how it is serialized
when attaching it to a test, you can provide your own implementation of
``Attachable/withUnsafeBytes(for:_:)``.

<!-- NOTE: not discussing attaching to activities here since there is not yet an
equivalent interface in Swift Testing. -->
