How the testing library interprets bug identifiers provided by developers.

## Overview

As a convenience, the testing library assumes that bug identifiers with specific
formats are associated with some common bug-tracking systems.

- Note: "Bugs" as described in this document may also be referred to as
  "issues." To avoid confusion with the ``Issue`` type in the testing library,
  this document consistently refers to them as "bugs."

## Recognized formats

- If the bug identifier begins with `"rdar:"`, it is assumed to represent a bug
  filed with Apple's Radar system.
- If the bug identifier can be parsed as a URL according to
  [RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt), it is assumed to represent
  an issue tracked at that URL.
- If the bug identifier can be parsed as an unsigned integer, it is assumed to
  represent an issue with that numeric identifier in an unspecified bug-tracking
  system.
- All other bug identifiers are considered invalid and will cause the compiler
  to generate an error at compile time.

<!--
Possible additional formats we could recognize (which would require special
handling to detect:

- If the bug identifier begins with `"FB"`, it is assumed to represent a bug
  filed with the [Apple Feedback Assistant](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com).
- If the bug identifier begins with `"#"` and can be parsed as a positive
  integer, it is assumed to represent a [GitHub](https://github.com) issue in
  the same repository as the test.
