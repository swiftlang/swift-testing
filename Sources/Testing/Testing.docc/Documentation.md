## Overview

With Swift Testing you leverage powerful and expressive capabilities of
the Swift programming language to develop tests with more confidence and less
code. The library integrates seamlessly with Swift Package Manager testing
workflow, supports flexible test organization, customizable metadata, and
scalable test execution. 

- Define test functions almost anywhere with a single attribute.
- Group related tests into hierarchies using Swift's type system.
- Integrate seamlessly with Swift concurrency.
- Parameterize test functions across wide ranges of inputs.
- Enable tests dynamically depending
on runtime conditions. 
- Parallelize tests in-process.
- Categorize tests using tags.
- Associate bugs directly with the tests that verify their fixes or reproduce
their problems.
