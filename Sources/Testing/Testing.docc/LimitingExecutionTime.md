Set limits on how long a test can run for until it fails.

## Overview

Some tests may naturally run slowly: they may require significant system
resources to complete, may rely on downloaded data from a server, or may
otherwise be dependent on external factors.

If a test may hang indefinitely or may consume too many system resources to
complete effectively, consider setting a time limit for it so that it's marked as failing if it runs for an excessive amount of time. Use the
``Trait/timeLimit(_:)`` trait as an upper bound:

```swift
@Test(.timeLimit(.seconds(60 * 60))
func serve100CustomersInOneHour() async {
  for _ in 0 ..< 100 {
    let customer = await Customer.next()
    await customer.order()
    ...
  }
}
```

If the above test function takes longer than an
hour (60 x 60 seconds) to execute, the task in which it's running is
[cancelled](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task/cancel())
and the test fails with an issue of kind
``Issue/Kind-swift.enum/timeLimitExceeded(timeLimitComponents:)``.

- Note: If multiple time limit traits apply to a test, the shortest time limit
  is used.

The testing library may adjust the specified time limit for performance reasons
or to ensure tests have enough time to run. In particular, a granularity of (by
default) one minute is applied to tests. The testing library can also be
configured with a maximum time limit per test that overrides any applied time
limit traits.

### Time limits applied to test suites

When a time limit is applied to a test suite, it's recursively applied to all
test functions and child test suites within that suite.

### Time limits applied to parameterized tests

When a time limit is applied to a parameterized test function, it's applied to
each invocation _separately_ so that if only some arguments cause failures, then
successful arguments aren't incorrectly marked as failing too.
