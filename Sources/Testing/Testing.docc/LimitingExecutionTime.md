Set limits on how long a test can run for until it fails.

## Overview

Some tests may naturally run slowly: they may require significant system
resources to complete, may rely on downloaded data from a server, or may
otherwise be dependent on external factors.

If a test may hang indefinitely or may consume too many system resources to
complete effectively, consider setting a time limit for it so that it's marked
as failing if it runs for an excessive amount of time. Use the
``Trait/timeLimit(_:)-4kzjp`` trait as an upper bound:

```swift
@Test(.timeLimit(.minutes(60))
func serve100CustomersInOneHour() async {
  for _ in 0 ..< 100 {
    let customer = await Customer.next()
    await customer.order()
    ...
  }
}
```

If the above test function takes longer than an
hour (60 x 60 seconds) to execute, the task in which it's running is
[cancelled](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task/cancel())
and the test fails with an issue of kind
``Issue/Kind-swift.enum/timeLimitExceeded(timeLimitComponents:)``.

- Note: If multiple time limit traits apply to a test, the testing library uses
  the shortest time limit.

The testing library may adjust the specified time limit for performance reasons
or to ensure tests have enough time to run. In particular, a granularity of (by
default) one minute is applied to tests. The testing library can also be
configured with a maximum time limit per test that overrides any applied time
limit traits.

### Apply time limits to test suites

When you apply a time limit to a test suite, the testing library recursively
applies it to all test functions and child test suites within that suite.
The time limit applies to each test in the test suite and any child test suites,
or each test case for parameterized tests.

### Apply time limits to parameterized tests

When you apply a time limit to a parameterized test function, the testing
library applies it to each invocation _separately_ so that if only some
cases cause failures due to timeouts, then the testing library doesn't
incorrectly mark successful cases as failing.
