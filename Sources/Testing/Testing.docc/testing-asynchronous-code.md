Validate whether your code causes expected events to happen.

## Overview

The testing library integrates with Swift concurrency, meaning that in many
situations you can test asynchronous code using standard Swift
features.  Mark your test function as `async` and, in the function
body, `await` any asynchronous interactions:

```swift
@Test func priceLookupYieldsExpectedValue() async {
  let mozarellaPrice = await unitPrice(for: .mozarella)
  #expect(mozarellaPrice == 3)
}
```

In more complex situations you can use ``Confirmation`` to discover whether an
expected event happens.

### Confirm that an event happens

Call ``confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)`` in your
asynchronous test function to create a `Confirmation` for the expected event. In
the trailing closure parameter, call the code under test. Swift Testing passes a
`Confirmation` as the parameter to the closure, which you call as a function in
the event handler for the code under test when the event you're testing for
occurs:

```swift
@Test("OrderCalculator successfully calculates subtotal for no pizzas")
func subtotalForNoPizzas() async {
  let calculator = OrderCalculator()
  await confirmation() { confirmation in
    calculator.successHandler = { _ in confirmation() }
    _ = await calculator.subtotal(for: PizzaToppings(bases: []))
  }
}
```

If you expect the event to happen more than once, set the
`expectedCount` parameter to the number of expected occurrences. The
test passes if the number of occurrences during the test matches the
expected count, and fails otherwise.

### Confirm that an event doesn't happen

To validate that a particular event doesn't occur during a test,
create a `Confirmation` with an expected count of `0`:

```swift
@Test func orderCalculatorEncountersNoErrors() async {
  let calculator = OrderCalculator()
  await confirmation(expectedCount: 0) { confirmation in
    calculator.errorHandler = { _ in confirmation() }
    calculator.subtotal(for: PizzaToppings(bases: []))
  }
}
```
