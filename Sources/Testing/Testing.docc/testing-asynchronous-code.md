Validate whether your code causes expected events to happen.

## Overview

The testing library integrates with Swift concurrency, meaning that in many
situations you can test asynchronous code using standard Swift
features.  Mark your test function as `async` and, in the function
body, `await` any asynchronous interactions:

```swift
@Test func priceLookupYieldsExpectedValue() async {
  let mozarellaPrice = await unitPrice(for: .mozarella)
  #expect(mozarellaPrice == 3)
}
```

In more complex situations you can use ``Confirmation`` to discover whether an
expected event happens.

### Confirm that an event happens

Call ``confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)-5mqz2`` in your
asynchronous test function to create a `Confirmation` for the expected event. In
the trailing closure parameter, call the code under test. Swift Testing passes a
`Confirmation` as the parameter to the closure, which you call as a function in
the event handler for the code under test when the event you're testing for
occurs:

```swift
@Test("OrderCalculator successfully calculates subtotal for no pizzas")
func subtotalForNoPizzas() async {
  let calculator = OrderCalculator()
  await confirmation() { confirmation in
    calculator.successHandler = { _ in confirmation() }
    _ = await calculator.subtotal(for: PizzaToppings(bases: []))
  }
}
```

If you expect the event to happen more than once, set the
`expectedCount` parameter to the number of expected occurrences. The
test passes if the number of occurrences during the test matches the
expected count, and fails otherwise.

You can also pass a range to ``confirmation(_:expectedCount:isolation:sourceLocation:_:)-6bkl6``
if the exact number of times the event occurs may change over time or is random:

```swift
@Test("Customers bought sandwiches")
func boughtSandwiches() async {
  await confirmation(expectedCount: 0 ..< 1000) { boughtSandwich in
    var foodTruck = FoodTruck()
    foodTruck.orderHandler = { order in
      if order.contains(.sandwich) {
        boughtSandwich()
      }
    }
    await FoodTruck.operate()
  }
}
```

In this example, there may be zero customers or up to (but not including) 1,000
customers who order sandwiches. Any [range expression](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rangeexpression)
which includes an explicit lower bound can be used:

| Range Expression | Usage |
|-|-|
| `1...` | If an event must occur _at least_ once |
| `5...` | If an event must occur _at least_ five times |
| `1 ... 5` | If an event must occur at least once, but not more than five times |
| `0 ..< 100` | If an event may or may not occur, but _must not_ occur more than 99 times |

### Confirm that an event doesn't happen

To validate that a particular event doesn't occur during a test,
create a `Confirmation` with an expected count of `0`:

```swift
@Test func orderCalculatorEncountersNoErrors() async {
  let calculator = OrderCalculator()
  await confirmation(expectedCount: 0) { confirmation in
    calculator.errorHandler = { _ in confirmation() }
    calculator.subtotal(for: PizzaToppings(bases: []))
  }
}
```
