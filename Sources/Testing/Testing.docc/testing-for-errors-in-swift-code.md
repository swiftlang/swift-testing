Ensure that your code handles errors in the way you expect.

## Overview

Write tests for your code that validate the conditions in which the
code throws errors, and the conditions in which it returns without
throwing an error. Use overloads of the ``expect(_:_:sourceLocation:)`` and
``require(_:_:sourceLocation:)-5l63q`` macros that check for errors.

### Validate that your code throws an expected error

Create a test function that `throws` and `try` the code under test.
If the code throws an error, then your test fails.

To check that the code under test throws a specific error, or to continue a
longer test function after the code throws an error, pass that error as the
first argument of ``expect(throws:_:sourceLocation:performing:)-7du1h``, and
pass a closure that calls the code under test:

```swift
@Test func cannotAddToppingToPizzaBeforeStartOfList() {
  var order = PizzaToppings(bases: [.calzone, .deepCrust])
  #expect(throws: PizzaToppings.Error.outOfRange) {
    try order.add(topping: .mozarella, toPizzasIn: -1..<0)
  }
}
```

If the closure completes without throwing an error, the testing library
records an issue. Other overloads of ``expect(_:_:sourceLocation:)`` let you
test that the code throws an error of a given type, or matches an arbitrary
Boolean test. Similar overloads of ``require(_:_:sourceLocation:)-5l63q`` stop
running your test if the code doesn't throw the expected error.

### Validate that your code doesn't throw an error

A test function that throws an error fails, which is usually sufficient for
testing that the code under test doesn't throw. If you need to record a
thrown error as an issue without stopping the test function, compare
the error to `Never`:

```swift
@Test func canAddToppingToPizzaInPositionZero() throws {
  var order = PizzaToppings(bases: [.thinCrust, .thinCrust])
  #expect(throws: Never.self) {
    try order.add(topping: .caper, toPizzasIn: 0..<1)
  }
  let toppings = try order.toppings(forPizzaAt: 0)
  #expect(toppings == [.caper])
}
```

If the closure throws _any_ error, the testing library records an issue.
If you need the test to stop when the code throws an error, include the
code inline in the test function instead of wrapping it in a call to
``expect(throws:_:sourceLocation:performing:)-7du1h``.

## Inspect an error thrown by your code

When you use `#expect(throws:)` or `#require(throws:)` and the error matches the
expectation, it is returned to the caller so that you can perform additional
validation. If the expectation fails because no error was thrown or an error of
a different type was thrown, `#expect(throws:)` returns `nil`:

```swift
@Test func cannotAddMarshmallowsToPizza() throws {
  let error = #expect(throws: PizzaToppings.InvalidToppingError.self) {
    try Pizza.current.add(topping: .marshmallows)
  }
  #expect(error?.topping == .marshmallows)
  #expect(error?.reason == .dessertToppingOnly)
}
```

If you aren't sure what type of error will be thrown, pass `(any Error).self`.
