/// A protocol that provides instances of conforming types with the ability to
/// record themselves as test issues.
///
/// When a type conforms to this protocol, values of that type can be passed to
/// ``Issue/record(_:_:_:)``. The testing library then calls the
/// ``customize(_:)`` function and passes it an instance of ``Issue`` that will
/// be used to represent the value. The function can then reconfigure or replace
/// the issue as needed.
///
/// This protocol may become part of the testing library's public interface in
/// the future. There's not really anything _requiring_ it to conform to `Error`
/// but all our current use cases are error types. If we want to allow other
/// types to be represented as issues, we will need to add an overload of
/// `Issue.record()` that takes `some CustomIssueRepresentable`.
protocol CustomIssueRepresentable: Error {
  /// Customize the issue that will represent this value.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - issue: The issue to customize. The function consumes this value.
  ///
  /// - Returns: A customized copy of `issue`.
