  /// for all elements in an exit test body's capture list and are stored in the
  /// exit test's ``capturedValues`` property. For example, given the following

  /// values are captured at the time the exit test is called, as they would be
  /// if the closure were called locally.

  /// instances of this type. When the handler is called, it is passed an
  /// instance of ``ExitTest``. The handler encodes the values in that
  /// instance's ``capturedValues`` property, then passes the encoded forms of
  /// those values to the child process. The encoding format and message-passing
  /// interface are implementation details of the exit test handler.
  ///
  /// When the child process calls ``ExitTest/find(identifiedBy:)``, it receives
  /// an instance of ``ExitTest`` whose ``capturedValues`` property contains
  /// type information but no values. The child process decodes the values it
  /// encoded in the parent process and then updates the ``wrappedValue``
