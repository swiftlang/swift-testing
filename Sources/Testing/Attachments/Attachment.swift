/// and inspected later by the user.
///

/// ``Attachable``. Initialize an instance of ``Attachment`` with that value
/// and, optionally, a preferred filename to use when saving the attachment. To
/// record the attachment, call ``Attachment/record(_:sourceLocation:)``.
/// Alternatively, pass your attachable value directly to ``Attachment/record(_:named:sourceLocation:)``.
///
/// By default, the testing library saves your attachments as soon as you call
/// ``Attachment/record(_:sourceLocation:)`` or
/// ``Attachment/record(_:named:sourceLocation:)``. You can access saved
/// attachments after your tests finish running:
///
/// - When using Xcode, you can access attachments from the test report.
/// - When using Visual Studio Code, the testing library saves attachments to
///   `.build/attachments` by default. Visual Studio Code reports the paths to
///   individual attachments in its Tests Results panel.
/// - When using Swift Package Manager's `swift test` command, you can pass the
///   `--attachments-path` option. The testing library saves attachments to the
///   specified directory.
