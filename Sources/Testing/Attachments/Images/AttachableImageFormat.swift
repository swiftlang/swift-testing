/// A type describing image formats supported by the system that can be used
/// when attaching an image to a test.
///
/// When you attach an image to a test, you can pass an instance of this type to
/// `Attachment.record(_:named:as:sourceLocation:)` so that the testing
/// library knows the image format you'd like to use. If you don't pass an
/// instance of this type, the testing library infers which format to use based
/// on the attachment's preferred name.
///
/// The PNG and JPEG image formats are always supported. The set of additional
/// supported image formats is platform-specific:
///
/// - On Apple platforms, you can use [`CGImageDestinationCopyTypeIdentifiers()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio/cgimagedestinationcopytypeidentifiers())
///   from the [Image I/O framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio)
///   to determine which formats are supported.
/// - On Windows, you can use [`IWICImagingFactory.CreateComponentEnumerator()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincodec/nf-wincodec-iwicimagingfactory-createcomponentenumerator)
///   to enumerate the available image encoders.
///
/// @Metadata {
///   @Available(Swift, introduced: 6.3)
/// }
