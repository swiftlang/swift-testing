/// ## Why can't images directly conform to Attachable?
///
/// Three reasons:
///
/// 1. Several image classes are not marked `Sendable`, which means that as far
///    as Swift is concerned, they cannot be safely passed to Swift Testing's
///    event handler (primarily because `Event` is `Sendable`.) So we would have
///    to eagerly serialize them, which is unnecessarily expensive if we know
///    they're actually concurrency-safe.
/// 2. We would have no place to store metadata such as the encoding quality
///    (although in the future we may introduce a "metadata" associated type to
///    `Attachable` that could store that info.)
/// 3. `Attachable` has a requirement with `Self` in non-parameter, non-return
///    position. As far as Swift is concerned, a non-final class cannot satisfy
///    such a requirement, and all image types we care about are non-final
///    classes. Thus, the compiler will steadfastly refuse to allow non-final
///    classes to conform to the `Attachable` protocol. We could get around this
///    by changing the signature of `withUnsafeBytes()` so that the
///    generic parameter to `Attachment` is not `Self`, but that would defeat
///    much of the purpose of making `Attachment` generic in the first place.
///    (And no, the language does not let us write `where T: Self` anywhere
///    useful.)

/// A protocol describing images that can be converted to instances of
/// [`Attachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/attachment).
///
/// Instances of types conforming to this protocol do not themselves conform to
/// [`Attachable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/attachable).
/// Instead, the testing library provides additional initializers on [`Attachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/attachment)
/// that take instances of such types and handle converting them to image data when needed.
///
/// You can attach instances of the following system-provided image types to a
/// test:
///
/// | Platform | Supported Types |
/// |-|-|
/// | macOS | [`CGImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgimage), [`CIImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/ciimage), [`NSImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage) |
/// | iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS | [`CGImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgimage), [`CIImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/ciimage), [`UIImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage) |
/// @Comment {
/// | Windows | [`HBITMAP`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdi/bitmaps), [`HICON`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/menurc/icons), [`IWICBitmapSource`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincodec/nn-wincodec-iwicbitmapsource) (including its subclasses declared by Windows Imaging Component) |
/// }
