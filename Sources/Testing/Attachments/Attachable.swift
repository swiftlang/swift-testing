/// A protocol describing a type that can be attached to a test report or
/// written to disk when a test is run.
///
/// To attach an attachable value to a test, pass it to ``Attachment/record(_:named:sourceLocation:)``.
/// To further configure an attachable value before you attach it, use it to
/// initialize an instance of ``Attachment`` and set its properties before
/// passing it to ``Attachment/record(_:sourceLocation:)``. An attachable
/// value can only be attached to a test once.
///
/// The testing library provides default conformances to this protocol for a
/// variety of standard library types. Most user-defined types do not need to
/// conform to this protocol.
///
/// A type should conform to this protocol if it can be represented as a
/// sequence of bytes that would be diagnostically useful if a test fails. If a
/// type cannot conform directly to this protocol (such as a non-final class or
/// a type declared in a third-party module), you can create a wrapper type that
/// conforms to ``AttachableWrapper`` to act as a proxy.
///
/// @Metadata {
///   @Available(Swift, introduced: 6.2)
/// }
public protocol Attachable: ~Copyable {
  /// An estimate of the number of bytes of memory needed to store this value as
  /// an attachment.
  ///
  /// The testing library uses this property to determine if an attachment
  /// should be held in memory or should be immediately persisted to storage.
  /// Larger attachments are more likely to be persisted, but the algorithm the
  /// testing library uses is an implementation detail and is subject to change.
  ///
  /// The value of this property is approximately equal to the number of bytes
  /// that will actually be needed, or `nil` if the value cannot be computed
  /// efficiently. The default implementation of this property returns `nil`.
  ///
  /// - Complexity: O(1) unless `Self` conforms to `Collection`, in which case
  ///   up to O(_n_) where _n_ is the length of the collection.
  ///
  /// @Metadata {
  ///   @Available(Swift, introduced: 6.2)

  /// Call a function and pass a buffer representing this instance to it.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - attachment: The attachment that is requesting a buffer (that is, the
  ///     attachment containing this instance.)
  ///   - body: A function to call. A temporary buffer containing a data
  ///     representation of this instance is passed to it.
  ///
  /// - Returns: Whatever is returned by `body`.
  ///
  /// - Throws: Whatever is thrown by `body`, or any error that prevented the
  ///   creation of the buffer.
  ///
  /// The testing library uses this function when writing an attachment to a
  /// test report or to a file on disk. The format of the buffer is
  /// implementation-defined, but should be "idiomatic" for this type: for
  /// example, if this type represents an image, it would be appropriate for
  /// the buffer to contain an image in PNG format, JPEG format, etc., but it
  /// would not be idiomatic for the buffer to contain a textual description of
  /// the image.
