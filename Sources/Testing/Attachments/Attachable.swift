/// A protocol describing a type whose instances can be recorded and saved as
/// part of a test run.
///
/// To attach an attachable value to a test, pass it to ``Attachment/record(_:named:sourceLocation:)``.
/// To further configure an attachable value before you attach it, use it to
/// initialize an instance of ``Attachment`` and set its properties before
/// passing it to ``Attachment/record(_:sourceLocation:)``.
///
/// The testing library provides default conformances to this protocol for a
/// variety of standard library types. Most user-defined types do not need to
/// conform to this protocol.
///
/// A type should conform to this protocol if it can be represented as a
/// sequence of bytes that would be diagnostically useful if a test fails. If a
/// type cannot conform directly to this protocol (such as a non-final class or
/// a type declared in a third-party module), you can create a wrapper type that
/// conforms to ``AttachableWrapper`` to act as a proxy.

  /// an attachment.

  /// The testing library uses this property to determine if an attachment
  /// should be held in memory or should be immediately saved. Larger
  /// attachments are more likely to be saved immediately, but the algorithm the
  /// testing library uses is an implementation detail and is subject to change.
  ///
  /// The value of this property is approximately equal to the number of bytes
  /// that will actually be needed, or `nil` if the value cannot be computed
  /// efficiently. The default implementation of this property returns `nil`.

  ///   up to O(_n_) where _n_ is the length of the collection.

  ///
  /// The testing library uses this function when saving an attachment. The

  /// for this type: for example, if this type represents an image, it would be
  /// appropriate for the buffer to contain an image in PNG format, JPEG format,
  /// etc., but it would not be idiomatic for the buffer to contain a textual
