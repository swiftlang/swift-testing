This document describes the format and location of test content that the testing
library emits at compile time and can discover at runtime.

> [!WARNING]
> The content of this document is subject to change pending efforts to define a
> Swift-wide standard mechanism for runtime metadata emission and discovery.
> Treat the information in this document as experimental.

## Basic format

Swift Testing stores test content records in a dedicated platform-specific
section in built test products:

| Platform | Binary Format | Section Name |
|-|:-:|-|
| macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, visionOS | Mach-O | `__DATA_CONST,__swift5_tests` |
| Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Android | ELF | `swift5_tests` |
| WASI | WebAssembly | `swift5_tests` |
| Windows | PE/COFF | `.sw5test$B`[^windowsPadding] |

[^windowsPadding]: On Windows, the Swift compiler [emits](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/blob/main/stdlib/public/runtime/SwiftRT-COFF.cpp)
  leading and trailing padding into this section, both zeroed and of size
  `MemoryLayout<UInt>.stride`. Code that walks this section must skip over this
  padding.

### Record layout

Regardless of platform, all test content records created and discoverable by the
testing library have the following layout:

```swift
typealias Accessor = @convention(c) (
  _ outValue: UnsafeMutableRawPointer,
  _ type: UnsafeRawPointer,
  _ hint: UnsafeRawPointer?
) -> CBool

typealias TestContentRecord = (
  kind: UInt32,
  reserved1: UInt32,
  accessor: Accessor?,
  context: UInt,
  reserved2: UInt
)
```

This type has natural size, stride, and alignment. Its fields are native-endian.
If needed, this type can be represented in C as a structure:

```c
typedef bool (* SWTAccessor)(
  void *outValue,
  const void *type,
  const void *_Nullable hint
);

struct SWTTestContentRecord {
  uint32_t kind;
  uint32_t reserved1;
  SWTAccessor _Nullable accessor;
  uintptr_t context;
  uintptr_t reserved2;
};
```

Do not use the `__TestContentRecord` or `__TestContentRecordAccessor` typealias
defined in the testing library. These types exist to support the testing
library's macros and may change in the future (e.g. to accomodate a generic
argument or to make use of a reserved field.)

Instead, define your own copy of these types where needed&mdash;you can copy the
definitions above _verbatim_. If your test record type's `context` field (as
described below) is a pointer type, make sure to change its type in your version
of `TestContentRecord` accordingly so that, on systems with pointer
authentication enabled, the pointer is correctly resigned at load time.

### Record content

#### The kind field

Each record's _kind_ determines how the record will be interpreted at runtime. A
record's kind is a 32-bit unsigned value. The following kinds are defined:

| As Hexadecimal | As [FourCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FourCC) | Interpretation |
|-:|:-:|-|
| `0x00000000` | &ndash; | Reserved (**do not use**) |
| `0x74657374` | `'test'` | Test or suite declaration |
| `0x65786974` | `'exit'` | Exit test |

<!-- When adding cases to this enumeration, be sure to also update the
corresponding enumeration in TestContentGeneration.swift. -->

If a test content record's `kind` field equals `0x00000000`, the values of all
other fields in that record are undefined.

#### The accessor field

The function `accessor` is a C function. When called, it initializes the memory
at `outValue` to an instance of the appropriate type and returns `true`; or, if
it could not generate the relevant content, it leaves the memory uninitialized
and returns `false`. On successful return, the caller is responsible for
deinitializing the memory at `outValue` when done with it.

If `accessor` is `nil`, the test content record is ignored. The testing library
may, in the future, define record kinds that do not provide an accessor function
(that is, they represent pure compile-time information only.)

The third argument to this function, `type`, is a pointer to the type[^mightNotBeSwift]
(not a bitcast Swift type) of the value expected to be written to `outValue`.
This argument helps to prevent memory corruption if two copies of Swift Testing
or a third-party library are inadvertently loaded into the same process. If the
value at `type` does not match the test content record's expected type, the
accessor function must return `false` and must not modify `outValue`.

<!-- TODO: discuss this argument's value in Embedded Swift (no metatypes) -->

[^mightNotBeSwift]: Although this document primarily deals with Swift, the test
  content record section is generally language-agnostic. The use of languages
  other than Swift is beyond the scope of this document. With that in mind, it
  is _technically_ feasible for a test content accessor to be written in (for
  example) C++, expect the `type` argument to point to a C++ value of type
  [`std::type_info`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/type_info), and
  write a C++ class instance to `outValue` using [placement `new`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/new#Placement_new).

The fourth argument to this function, `hint`, is an optional input that can be
passed to help the accessor function determine if its corresponding test content
record matches what the caller is looking for. If the caller passes `nil` as the
`hint` argument, the accessor behaves as if it matched (that is, no additional
filtering is performed.)

The concrete Swift type of the value written to `outValue`, the type pointed to
by `type`, and the value pointed to by `hint` depend on the kind of record:

- For test or suite declarations (kind `0x74657374`), the accessor produces a
  structure of type `Testing.Test.Generator` that the testing library can use
  to generate the corresponding test[^notAccessorSignature].

  [^notAccessorSignature]: This level of indirection is necessary because
    loading a test or suite declaration is an asynchronous operation, but C
    functions cannot be `async`.

  Test content records of this kind do not specify a type for `hint`. Always
  pass `nil`.

- For exit test declarations (kind `0x65786974`), the accessor produces a
  structure describing the exit test (of type `Testing.ExitTest`.)

  Test content records of this kind accept a `hint` of type `Testing.ExitTest.ID`.
  They only produce a result if they represent an exit test declared with the
  same ID (or if `hint` is `nil`.)

> [!WARNING]
> Calling code should use [`withUnsafeTemporaryAllocation(of:capacity:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withunsafetemporaryallocation(of:capacity:_:))
> and/or [`withUnsafePointer(to:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withunsafepointer(to:_:)-35wrn)
> to ensure the pointers passed to `accessor` are large enough and are
> well-aligned. If they are not large enough to contain values of the
> appropriate types (per above), or if `type` or `hint` points to uninitialized
> or incorrectly-typed memory, the result is undefined.

#### The context field

This field can be used by test content to store additional context for a test
content record that needs to be made available before the accessor is called:

- For test or suite declarations (kind `0x74657374`), this field contains a bit
  mask with the following flags currently defined:

  | Bit | Value | Description |
  |-:|-:|-|
  | `1 << 0` | `1` | This record contains a suite declaration |
  | `1 << 1` | `2` | This record contains a parameterized test function declaration |

  Other bits are reserved for future use and must be set to `0`.

- For exit test declarations (kind `0x65786974`), this field is reserved for
  future use and must be set to `0`.

#### The reserved1 and reserved2 fields

These fields are reserved for future use. Always set them to `0`.

## Third-party test content

Testing tools may make use of the same storage and discovery mechanisms by
emitting their own test content records into the test record content section.

Third-party test content should set the `kind` field to a unique value only used
by that tool, or used by that tool in collaboration with other compatible tools.
At runtime, Swift Testing ignores test content records with unrecognized `kind`
values. To reserve a new unique `kind` value, open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-testing/issues/new/choose)
against Swift Testing.

The layout of third-party test content records must be compatible with that of
`TestContentRecord` as specified above. Third-party tools are ultimately
responsible for ensuring the values they emit into the test content section are
correctly aligned and have sufficient padding; failure to do so may render
downstream test code unusable.

      since we don't have a public initializer for the `Test` type.
